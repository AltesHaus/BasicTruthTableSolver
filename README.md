# Logical Expression Truth Table Generator

This Python application generates a truth table for any logical expression using Boolean variables (A, B, C, D). The user inputs the logical expression, and the truth table for that expression is displayed.

## Features
- Supports logical expressions with variables: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`.
- Supports logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- Dynamically creates a truth table based on the input expression.
- Simple error handling for invalid logical statements.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the `main.py` file.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AltesHaus/BasicTruthTableSolver.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd BasicTruthTableSolver
    ```

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script by entering the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Input your logical statement when prompted. The application will recognize the variables `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, and print a truth table based on the expression.

### Example:

If you input the logical statement:
A and (B or not C)
